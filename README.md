# PyRecording

Software to record music from apple music, identify the song and save the recording

future changes:
save recordings to a specific folder
clean up temporary files after the job is done like identification.wav and recording.wav
allow batch recordings by allowing a specified batch time file to allow playlists to just be run and recorded overnight
figure out how to deal with songs that can't be identified in a better manner (perhaps pulling from the apple music api
instead of using shazam to id songs)
